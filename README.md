# taxonomy_menux Drupal Module

The [taxonomy_menu](https://drupal.org/project/taxonomy\_menu) module allows configuration of a menu to be automatically populated with links to terms of a vocabulary. This saves the step of having to manually enter/edit a menu item whenever a taxonomy term is created or edited. 

__taxonomy\_menux__ however, performs a similar sort of behaviour but also allows the taxonomy term link in the menu to be renamed or positioned in a different part of the menu structure during the same step as term creation/edit. This is particularly helpful if you have other non-taxonomy term based (nodes, views, etc.) items in your menu structure but want to save time on double entry into both taxonomy and menu.

The module was based on Drupal core code from the menu, node and taxonomy modules.
